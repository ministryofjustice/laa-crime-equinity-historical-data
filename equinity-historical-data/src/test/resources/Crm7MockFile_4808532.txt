was a case where Counsel was assigned.  The matter involved vulnerable juveniles and if the Defendant was an adult he would be tried in the Crown Court.  The case comprised unusually grave and difficult features being dealt with by the Youth Court.  These difficulties included but were not limited to the age of the complainant and the nature of the allegations.  It was therefore necessary that there be an element of arm's length between trial advocate and instructing solicitors in these circumstances.  It was also anticipated that the Crown would use counsel in this case given the complexities and age of witnesses.   It was also necessary to spend a considerable amount of time with the Defendant prior to his trial to go through the evidence at length and to enable a full statement to be prepared to assist in trial.  A total of 6 1/2 hours was spent with the Defendant 3 days prior to his trial in preparation. The trial in this case lasted 2 days and the Defendant was acquitted.","Originator_tl_googleid":"","Sc_matter_type":3,"Client_ufn":"070623/004","Cd_serious_fraud_case":"No","Originator_type":0,"Cfc_total_phone_costs":32.72,"Showrbbawarning":false,"Waiting_rate_london":27.6,"Total_attendance_costs_counsel":0,"Cdsp_category_1_type":"","Total_travel_time_display":"0:12","Cfc_disb_total_net_ou":0,"Cfc_total_letter_cost":359.92,"Cdsp_category_3_radio":false,"Fi_dtreceived":"2024-03-13T13:15:45","Hide":"","Ct_profit_costs_vat_rate":20,"Fi_form_subtype":"H","Solicitorname":"Hercules Poirot","Attendance_rate_counsel_london":35.68,"Fc_current_user_type":"Provider","Full_grant_notes":"","Caseworker":"","Firm_address":"MILLBANK HOUSE\nNORTHWAY\nRUNCORN\nCHESHIRE\nWA7 2SX","Fc_currentstage":"Initial","Cw_total_preparation_costs":365.06,"Ctou_travel_costs_total":6.62,"Originator_dtlastaccessed":"2023-11-16T11:03:01","Urn":"07NZ0754222","Cfc_cw_calls_uplift":100,"Total_attendance_time_no_counsel":7.3,"TLActionsOnLine":"Name,Type,SignatureButton,SignType\r\nSubmit,1,Solicitor_sign,1\r\nDelete the Form,-1,Solicitor_sign,0\r\nSend for Internal Review,1,Solicitor_sign,0","Originator_tl_qn_answer_hash":"","Client_name":"","Originator_displayname":"Hercules Poirot","Decided_by_original":"","Cfc_cw_no_of_calls":4,"Prog":"PROG","Sd_address_line_1":"","Cdsp_other_details":"","Cp_rbba_category_before_qc":"","Rep_order_date":"2023-06-20T00:00:00","Emailto":"eformsPOA@legalaid.gsi.gov.uk","Sd_address_line_3":"","Sd_address_line_2":"","Form_version":2,"Total_preparation_time":3.5,"Cld_no_of_defence_witnesses":1,"Unique_reference_number":"","Attendance_rate_counsel_non_london":35.68,"Fc_rfi_text":"Please send through the full file","Advocacy_rate_london":65.42,"Rbba_category":"","Cdsp_category_3_type":"","Solicitor_sign_date":"2024-03-13T00:00:00","Usn":4808532,"Fc_info_returned":false,"Total_travel_time":0.2,"Originator_notificationmethod":2,"Total_attendance_time":0,"Tltaskid":4808532,"Tltaskstate":19,"Cld_supplemental_claim":"No","Ctou_travel_costs_vat_rate":20,"Cld_prev_claims_attach_method":"","Attendance_rate_no_counsel_non_london":52.15,"Statutory_charge":"","Originator_jobtitle":"Office Manager","Sc_case_in_designated_area":"No","Cdsp_category":"Category 2","Sc_date_class_of_work":"2023-12-21T00:00:00","Cd_main_offence":"SEXUAL OFFENCES","Client_surname":"Bond","Letter_rate_non_london":4.09,"Tlreadonly":0,"Cld_prosecution_pages":124,"Total_advocacy_costs":65.42,"Cfc_calls_rate":4.09,"Printed":false,"Sc_no_of_defendants":1,"Ct_waiting_costs_vat_rate":20,"Firm_supplier_no":"0W356P","Cat1national":542.63,"Total_preparation_costs":365.06,"Fc_processingofficedx":"DX 10035 Nottingham 1","Fc_ok_to_autogrant":false,"Prog_prov":"PROG","Originator_uniquename":"HERCULESPOIROT","Prom":"PROM","Originator_id":5800,"Originator_tl_neverpermanentlyremove":0,"Preparation_rate_london":52.15,"Cd_offence_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00","Referral_reason_sol":"","Nsfc_other":false,"Originator_firm":"BELL LAMB & JOYNSON","Firm_name":"BELL LAMB & JOYNSON","Fc_rfi_options":"","Fc_reject_reasons_text":"","Cw_total_waiting_costs":13.8,"Ct_waiting_costs_total":16.56,"Cdsp_category_2_type":"Not guilty plea","Fc_initial_processingoffice":"Nottingham","Fc_decision_explanation":"","Fc_processingofficeaddress":"Legal Aid Agency\n3rd Floor, 1 Unity Square\nQueensbridge Road\nNottingham\nNG2 1AW","Date_received":"2024-03-13T00:00:00","Voucherrequired_count":0,"Fc_cw_requesting":"","Cfc_cw_total_costs":392.64,"Total_attendance_time_counsel":0,"Originator__dtadded":"2011-08-03T00:00:00","Fc_return_info_to_cw":false,"Cfc_disb_total_vat":0,"Sc_eo_code":"01MN","Rep_order_no":7636747,"Match_carried_out":false,"Cfc_disb_attach_method":"","Fc_possible_reject_reasons":"","Letter_rate_london":4.09,"Solicitorid":"2023/30982","Sd_address_county":"","Maat_number":"","Cw_total_attendance_costs_counsel":0,"Submitter_user_id":"HERCULESPOIROT"},"read_only":false,"signature_data":"REaBEAAOAFNvbGljaXRvcl9zaWdughYAFAAk517iLOcu4KDQb3eztUc3cJyLDIMRAA8AQmV2ZXJsZXkgTGVlbWFuhBAADgBCRVZFUkxFWUxFRU1BToUCAAAAhggA7+7urpEm5kCHAgAAAIgCAAAA//8=","attachfields":"","SectionStates":{"State":["INITIAL","INITIAL","INITIAL","INITIAL","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","COMPLETE","INITIAL","COMPLETE","INITIAL","INITIAL","INITIAL"],"SectionName":["Genericfields","Standard_properties","Claim_properties","Select_office","Summary_of_claim","Solicitors_details","Case_details","Non_standard_fee_claim","Case_disposal","Claim_details","Pre_order_work","Schedule_of_time","Claim_for_costs","Disbursements","Claim_totals","Coversheet","Relevant_case_info","Furtherinfosection","Officeuseonly","Referral"]
